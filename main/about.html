			<h2>Imagine measuring someone’s heart rate without even being in the same room as them...</h2><br>

			<p>Technology can revolutionize how we extract and analyze biometric information.</p>
			<p>The face flushes slightly with each pump of blood—over time to reveal a person's heart rate. Our application applies this theory in order to make <strong>a technology that can detect a user's heart beat and requires nothing more than a video</strong>. It can handle moving faces and both dark and light skin tones in natural conditions: subjects can move about naturally, and no special lighting is required. The application works in real time (~15 seconds) and is accurate within 5 beats per minute.</p>
			<p>This work has <strong>the potential to revolutionize medical care</strong>, especially in developing countries where more people have smart phones than access to medical care, and it has many <strong>security and defense applications</strong>: detecting spoofed faces, finding live soldiers who need to be evacuated from battlefields, and analyzing the emotions of subjects during polygraphs, high-stakes meetings, or media appearances.</p><br>
