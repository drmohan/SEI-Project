            ABOUT
            <p>
            Imagine measuring someone’s heart rate without even touching them…from hundreds of miles away. Technology can revolutionize how we extract and analyze biometric information, and the application we demonstrate here can extract a subject’s heart rate using only video.  
            </p>
            <p>
            This application is completely touchless and analyzes subtle changes in the color of the face—the face flushes slightly with each pump of blood—over time to reveal a person's heart rate. It can handle moving faces and both dark and light skin tones in natural conditions: subjects can move about naturally, and no special lighting is required. The application works in real time (~15 seconds) and is accurate to within 5 beats per minute. 
            </p>
            <p>
            This work has the potential to revolutionize medical care, especially in developing countries where more people have smart phones than access to medical care, and it has many security and defense applications: detecting spoofed faces, finding live soldiers who need to be evacuated from battlefields, and analyzing the emotions of subjects during polygraphs, high-stakes meetings, or media appearances.
