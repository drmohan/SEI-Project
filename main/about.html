                Technology can revolutionize how we extract and analyze biometric information.

                The face flushes slightly with each pump of blood—over time to reveal a person's heart rate. Our application applies this theory in order to make <strong>a technology that can detect a user's heart beat and requires nothing more than a video</strong>. It can handle moving faces and both dark and light skin tones in natural conditions: subjects can move about naturally, and no special lighting is required. The application works in real time (~15 seconds) and is accurate to within 5 beats per minute.

                This work has <strong>the potential to revolutionize medical care</strong>, especially in developing countries where more people have smart phones than access to medical care, and it has many <strong>security and defense applications</strong>: detecting spoofed faces, finding live soldiers who need to be evacuated from battlefields, and analyzing the emotions of subjects during polygraphs, high-stakes meetings, or media appearances.
